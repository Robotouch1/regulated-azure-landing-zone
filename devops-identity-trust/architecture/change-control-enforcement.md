## Enterprise Implementation Note
Azure DevOps Environments with Approvals & Checks were the preferred enforcement point.
In this lab tenant, Environments approvals were not available due to plan/entitlement limitations.
A ManualValidation approval gate was implemented in YAML to demonstrate the same change-control intent.
